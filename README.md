## Update
We're releasing a package named [Multi-Freq-LDPy](https://github.com/hharcolezi/multi-freq-ldpy) for Multiple Frequency Estimation Under Local Differential Privacy in Python.

## Content
This repository is organized per paper (experiments and protocols) and is regularly updated. Please refer to the [papers](https://github.com/hharcolezi/ldp-protocols-mobility-cdrs/tree/main/papers) folder.

## Keywords
differential privacy, local differential privacy, longitudinal studies, multidimensional data, big data privacy, human mobility, privacy-preserving machine learning.

## Environment
I mainly used Python3 with numpy, pandas, and numba libaries. Although not tested, the codes should run with any recent versions. The versions I use are listed below:

- Python 3.8.8
- Numpy 1.19.5
- Pandas 1.2.4
- Numba 0.53.1
